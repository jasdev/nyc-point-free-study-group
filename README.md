# NYC Point-Free Study Group

A weekly(-ish and (very) informal) get-together to watch episodes of [Point-Free](https://www.pointfree.co). And, if there’s enough time or interest, a chance to work through exercises with peers.

## Logistics

Watchings will be held from 6:30–7:30pm Eastern time at Peloton’s office ([125 W 25th St., New York, NY 10001](https://maps.apple.com/?address=125%20W%2025th%20St,%20New%20York,%20NY%20%2010001,%20United%20States&ll=40.744740,-73.992678&q=125%20W%2025th%20St&_ext=EiYpXpeGd8BeREAx16L2Kel/UsA53Gys0+ZfREBBIdkh5iZ/UsBQAw%3D%3D)). Upon arrival, send Jasdev a DM in the iOS Folks Slack (`@jasdev`) and he can badge you up.

Light snacks and drinks—seltzer, soda, tea, coffee, chips, and the like—will be available. Note, the office’s conference rooms only fit ~8–10 folks, so, Jasdev might need help hosting if more than that many are interested in attending.

For the fellow calendar nerds, here’s an [`.ics` link](https://user.fm/calendar/v1-b88d068d40c340849570a49f68c376ae/NYC%20Point-Free%20Study%20Group.ics).

### Joining remotely

We’d love to have you join us, even if you’re not in New York. Here’s how—

We’ll start the viewing at ~6:30pm and then open a Hangout _afterwards_ (here’s the [latest link](https://meet.google.com/qmp-hden-jra) and it’ll also be in the shared calendar) to work on and discuss exercises. So, feel free to hop in at 6:30pm + (that week’s episode length) + (a few minutes buffer). It’s also totally cool if you want to listen in on the conversation without participating.

## Format

We’ll watch an episode, take a break afterwards—during which folks can head out, use the restroom, etc.—, and then talk through the episode’s exercises and otherwise nerd out amongst friends.

## Code of Conduct

Study group sessions are a safe space to learn and grow as an engineer. As such, attendees are asked to follow Recurse’s [Social Rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) and [Code of Conduct](https://www.recurse.com/code-of-conduct).

## Etceteras

Jasdev will try his best to keep both the shared calendar and #[func-programming](https://iosdevelopers.slack.com/messages/C034QKFU2) channel up to date with any schedule changes or skipped weeks.

If you need to get in touch, DM in iOS Folks or reach out by [email](mailto:j@jasdev.me).
