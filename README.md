# NYC Point-Free Study Group

A weekly(-ish and (very) informal) get-together to watch episodes of [Point-Free][1]. And, if there’s enough time or interest, a chance to work through exercises with peers.

## Logistics

Watchings will be held from 6:30–7:30pm Eastern time at Peloton’s office ([125 W 25th St., New York, NY 10001][2]). Upon arrival, send Jasdev a DM in the iOS Folks Slack (`@jasdev`) and he can badge you up.

Light snacks and drinks—seltzer, soda, tea, coffee, chips, and the like—will be available. Note, the office’s conference rooms only fit \~8–10 folks, so, Jasdev might need help hosting if more than that many are interested in attending.

For the fellow calendar nerds, here’s an [`.ics` link][3].

### Joining remotely

We’d love to have you join us, even if you’re not in New York. Here’s how—

We’ll start the viewing at \~6:30pm and then open a Hangout _afterwards_ (here’s the [latest link][4] and it’ll also be in the shared calendar) to work on and discuss exercises. So, feel free to hop in at 6:30pm + (that week’s episode length) + (a few minutes buffer). It’s also totally cool if you want to listen in on the conversation without participating.

## Format

We’ll watch an episode, take a break afterwards—during which folks can head out, use the restroom, etc.—, and then talk through the episode’s exercises and otherwise nerd out amongst friends.

## Code of Conduct

Study group sessions are a safe space to learn and grow as an engineer. As such, attendees are asked to follow Recurse’s [Social Rules][17] and [Code of Conduct][18].

## Etceteras

Jasdev will try his best to keep both the shared calendar and \#[func-programming][19] channel up to date with any schedule changes or skipped weeks.

If you need to get in touch, DM in iOS Folks or reach out by [email][20].
