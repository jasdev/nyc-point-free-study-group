# NYC Point-Free Study Group

A weekly(-ish and (very) informal) get-together to watch episodes of [Point-Free][1]. And, if there’s enough time or interest, a chance to work through exercises with peers.

For the fellow calendar nerds, here’s an [`.ics` link][3].

## Logistics

### Joining

We’d love to have you join us, Here’s how—

We’ll start a Zoom call at \~7:00pm* Eastern Time (here’s the [latest link][4] and it’ll also be in the shared calendar) to work on and discuss the episode and exercises. It’s also totally cool if you want to listen in on the conversation without participating.

*There might be a slightly shifted week here and there.

## Format

We’ll watch the episode on our own before meeting—for now with the remote-only setup—, and then pair through the episode’s exercises and otherwise nerd out amongst friends.

## Code of Conduct

Study group sessions are a safe space to learn and grow as an engineer. As such, attendees are asked to follow Recurse’s [Social Rules][17] and [Code of Conduct][18].

## Etceteras

Jasdev will try his best to keep both the shared calendar and \#[func-programming][19] channel up to date with any schedule changes or skipped weeks.

If you need to get in touch, DM in iOS Folks or reach out by [email][20].
